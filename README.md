# fruit-bot
A fruit harvester bot, built to identify and collect only ripe "fruits" from a tree. Uses rudimentary image processing on OpenCV to identify the correctly coloured ball, using Hough circles method. Uses an Arduino Uno to control the movement of the bot and the functioning of a robotic arm to collect the identified fruit.
